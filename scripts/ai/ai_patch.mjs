/**
 * Placeholder: AI-driven patch generation script.
 *
 * What you should implement here:
 * 1) Fetch issue body via GitHub API (or pass in as input)
 * 2) Build context (relevant files, docs/tech-design.md, etc.)
 * 3) Call your LLM provider (Anthropic/OpenAI) to generate a unified diff
 * 4) Apply diff, run tests/typecheck
 * 5) Commit and push a branch
 * 6) Create PR
 *
 * IMPORTANT SECURITY:
 * - Never allow untrusted users to trigger this in public repos (secrets!)
 * - Keep PR small, and require human review.
